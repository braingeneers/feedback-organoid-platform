## Overview

<img src="./img/overview.jpg" height="280">
This work presents a laboratory robotics system that uses IoT collaboration to improve the control of cell culture experiments.
The main parts include software for IoT devices, computer vision analysis, an example  bill of materials, and 3D printed components for setting up the system.
This repository includes documentation on how to use and assemble the system.

## Hardware
- Bill of Materials (BOM) for putting together the system is inside [`./hardware`](https://github.com/braingeneers/integrated-system-v1-paper/tree/main/hardware).
- CAD files for 3D printed files and reference assemblies are inside [`./hardware/3D_printed_parts`](https://github.com/braingeneers/integrated-system-v1-paper/tree/main/hardware/3D_printed_parts).
